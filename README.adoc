== Dotfiles for dev environments

*_This repository contains a minimal set of ❣️ dotfiles for my development environments_*

-> These files are meant to be used within *https://containers.dev[devcontainers]* and *https://github.com/features/codespaces[GitHub Codespace]* / *https://coder.com[Coder]*.

* My actual https://github.com/marc-0x01/nixos-config/tree/master/home[workstations dotfiles] are all managed with `home-manager` and `Nix`, give it a look!
* My project templates are build around `devcontainers` and `devenv`. They can be found https://github.com/dro-id[here].

=== Features

* 🐂 Just enough configuration to tailor the dev environment to my habits, the rest should be standardized and pinned!
* 💲 `Bash` based for maximum compatibility with underlying containers
* 🐚 Essentially a _minimalistic_ and _sensible_ shell configuration
* ❌ No editor configuration, this is covered by `Visual Studio Code` (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync[settings sync])
* ❌ No dependencies installation, this is covered by the `devcontainers` themselves

🔜 TODO

* [ ] Tweak, then tweak again!

=== Installation

. Just run the `install.sh` script to make the symlinks. +
This is done as part of the devcontainer bootstrap.
[source,bash]
----
  ./install.sh
----

. To enable the dotfile to be it installed by `Codespace` +
In your personnal GitHub workspace: "Settings" -> "Codespace". +
Under "Dotfiles", select _Automatically install dotfiles so that GitHub Codespaces automatically installs your dotfiles into every new codespace you create_.

=== Contributing

I don't claim to be a `bash` guru, so there are certainly improvements that could be made. +
Feel free to suggest them!
